Penetration Testing Student
For a novice, entering the information security field can be overwhelming. You may not know what the career paths are, and professionals tend to use a lot of industry jargon. Being an IT security professional means having a strong technical background and a deep understanding of the penetration testing process. The Penetration Testing Student Learning Path covers prerequisite topics introducing you to information security, programming, and pentesting. The learning path also prepares you for the eJPT exam and certification, as well as provides the information required to start your career into pentesting.
